Saturator would be really good for a lead drop synth

Grain delay could be cool ffor some kind of high hat thing

going to need a sub pluck synth for single lower notes to tie in with the oversynth

having an accent guitar piece would fit really well too I thinks  (Guitar Darling, under intrument rack > guitars > acoustic)
